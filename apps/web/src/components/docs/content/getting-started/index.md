## What is Featul?

Featul is a customer feedback platform that helps you collect user feedback, prioritize feature requests, and share product updates—all in one place.

### Core concepts

- **Workspaces** – A workspace is your home base. It contains all your boards, team members, and settings for a single product or company.
- **Boards** – Boards organize feedback into focused areas. You can create public boards for customer ideas, private boards for internal discussions, or specialized boards for your roadmap and changelog.
- **Posts** – Posts are individual pieces of feedback, feature requests, or changelog entries. Users can vote on posts to help you prioritize.
- **Members** – Your team members who collaborate on reviewing feedback, managing the roadmap, and publishing updates.

## Quick start guide

### 1. Create your workspace

Sign in to Featul and create a workspace for your product. This sets up your feedback portal with default branding and settings.

### 2. Set up your first board

Go to **Settings → Boards** and create a public feedback board. This is where your customers will submit ideas and vote on features they want.

### 3. Invite your team

Add team members so they can help triage feedback, respond to users, and manage your roadmap. Go to **Settings → Team** to send invites.

### 4. Enable roadmap and changelog

Most teams benefit from having a public roadmap (to show what's planned) and a changelog (to announce what shipped). Enable these from your board settings.

### 5. Share with customers

Share your workspace URL with customers so they can start submitting feedback. You can use your default subdomain (`yourproduct.featul.com`) or set up a custom domain.
