## Team roles

Every team member has a role that determines their access level:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access to everything—settings, billing, members, and all boards |
| **Member** | Can work with feedback, boards, roadmap, and changelog |
| **Viewer** | Can browse and read content but has limited editing capabilities |

## Additional permissions

Beyond roles, you can grant specific permissions to fine-tune access:

- **Manage workspace** – Change workspace settings and configuration
- **Manage billing** – Access subscription and payment settings
- **Manage members** – Invite, remove, and modify team members
- **Manage boards** – Create, edit, and delete boards
- **Moderate all boards** – Review and manage content across all boards
- **Configure branding** – Customize appearance, logo, and theme

## How to invite a team member

1. Go to **Settings → Team** in your workspace
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter their email address
4. Select a role (Admin, Member, or Viewer)
5. Adjust additional permissions if needed
6. Click **Send invite**

The person will receive an email with a link to join your workspace. Once they accept, they'll appear in your team list.

## Managing your team

From the team settings page, you can:

- **Change roles** – Promote or adjust a member's access level
- **Update permissions** – Grant or revoke specific capabilities
- **Resend invites** – Re-send the invitation email for pending invites
- **Revoke invites** – Cancel invitations that haven't been accepted
- **Remove members** – Remove someone from your workspace

## Best practices

- Start with the most restrictive role that still lets the person do their job
- Use **Viewer** for stakeholders who need visibility but shouldn't edit
- Reserve **Admin** for people who need to manage settings and billing
- Regularly review your team list and remove inactive members
