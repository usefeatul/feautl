## What is identity masking?

Identity masking hides user information on your public portal while keeping full details visible to your team internally. This lets you maintain privacy without losing context.

## How it works

| Setting | Public portal sees | Your team sees |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Masking off** | User names and avatars | Full user details |
| **Masking on** | "Anonymous" or generic labels | Full user details |

When masking is enabled:
- Public visitors see anonymized labels instead of names
- Your team still sees who submitted each post or comment
- Internal relationships and context are preserved

## Enabling identity masking

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select a public board
3. Enable **Hide member identity on public views**
4. Save changes

The setting takes effect immediately on your public portal.

## Identity masking vs anonymous feedback

These are two different features:

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Anonymous feedback** | Lets visitors submit without signing in. You don't know who they are. |
| **Identity masking** | Signed-in users submit normally, but their identity is hidden publicly. You still know who they are. |

### When to use each

- **Anonymous feedback** – When you want zero friction and don't need to know who's submitting
- **Identity masking** – When you need to track who submitted (for follow-up) but want to protect their privacy publicly

## Combining both features

You can use both together:

- Enable anonymous feedback to let anyone submit
- Enable identity masking to hide signed-in users on the public portal

This gives you:
- Clean public boards that respect everyone's privacy
- Full internal context for your team to follow up and prioritize

## Use cases

Identity masking is useful when:

- Customers are sensitive about being identified publicly
- You're collecting internal feedback that shouldn't expose employees
- You want to prevent competitive intelligence gathering
- Users might be more honest with anonymity
