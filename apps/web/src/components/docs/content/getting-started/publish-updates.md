## What is a changelog board?

A changelog board is where you announce what you've shipped. It's a dedicated space for release notes that keeps your customers informed about new features, improvements, and fixes.

## Use cases

Changelog boards are perfect for:

- **Public release notes** – Let customers know what's new
- **Internal change logs** – Keep your team informed
- **Connecting updates to feedback** – Show users their requests were heard

## Changelog tags

Organize your updates with tags that describe the type of change:

| Tag | Use for |
|-----|---------|
| **Feature** | New functionality |
| **Improvement** | Enhancements to existing features |
| **Fix** | Bug fixes |
| **Performance** | Speed and optimization updates |
| **Security** | Security patches and updates |

Tags help readers quickly scan and find relevant updates.

## Creating a changelog entry

1. Open your workspace and navigate to your **Changelog** board
2. Click **New entry**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Title** – A clear headline for the update
   - **Content** – Explain what changed and why it matters
   - **Tags** – Select the type of change
4. Click **Publish**

Your entry appears on the changelog board and can be linked from related roadmap items or feedback posts.

## Linking updates to feedback

When you ship something that came from user feedback:

1. Update the original request's roadmap status to **Completed**
2. Reference the request in your changelog content
3. Include a link back to the feedback post

This closes the loop with users and shows that their feedback led to real changes.

## Displaying your changelog

Your changelog is available at:

- Your workspace subdomain: `yourproduct.featul.com/changelog`
- Your custom domain (if configured): `feedback.yourdomain.com/changelog`

This gives customers a single place to discover what's new without needing a separate release notes tool.
