## Roles and permissions

Team access in featul is based on roles and optional extra permissions.

Every member has a **role**:

- **Admin** – full access to settings, billing, and workspace configuration.
- **Member** – can work with feedback, boards, roadmap, and changelog.
- **Viewer** – can browse feedback and roadmap but has limited editing access.

You can further refine access with additional permissions, for example:

- Managing the workspace and billing.
- Managing other members and boards.
- Moderating all boards.
- Configuring branding and appearance.

These controls keep sensitive areas restricted while still letting teammates work with feedback day to day.

## Inviting a new member

1. Open your workspace in the app.
2. Go to **Settings → Team** or the members section.
3. Click **Invite member**.
4. Enter the teammate’s email address.
5. Choose a **role** (admin, member, viewer).
6. Adjust any advanced permissions if available.
7. Send the invite.

The teammate receives an email with a link to join your workspace. Once they accept, they appear in your members list with the role you selected.

## Managing membership

From the team settings page you can:

- Change a member’s role and permissions.
- Temporarily deactivate a member.
- Resend or revoke pending invites.

These actions control what each user can see and do across boards, roadmap, and changelog.
