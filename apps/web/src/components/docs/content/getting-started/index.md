Featul helps you collect user feedback, prioritize feature requests, and share product updates—all in one place.

## 1. Create a Free Account

Sign up with Google, GitHub, or email. If you use email, verify your account with the code sent to your inbox.

## 2. Create Your Workspace

Enter a workspace name and choose a subdomain (e.g., `yourproduct.featul.com`). This sets up your feedback portal.

## 3. Set Up Your First Board
