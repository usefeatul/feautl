## Public vs private

Each board has two important visibility options:

- Whether the board is accessible on your public feedback portal.
- Whether the board appears in navigation, even if it is public.

A **private board** is a board that is not exposed on the public portal. Only authenticated workspace members can access it through the internal app.

You can also create “hidden public” boards that can be visited via a direct link without being listed everywhere.

## Creating a private board

1. Open your workspace.
2. Go to **Settings → Boards**.
3. Create a new board or edit an existing one.
4. Turn off the **Public** option.
5. Save changes.

From this point:

- New posts on the board are only visible to workspace members.
- Public users will not see the board listed or be able to submit feedback to it.

## Use cases

Private boards work well for:

- Internal feedback from customer-facing teams.
- Backlog grooming and triage discussions.
- Experiments and early-stage ideas that you are not ready to share.

All posts and comments still follow the same workflow as other boards. The difference is that access is enforced at the board level based on visibility and the current user’s membership.

## Converting boards later

You can switch a board from private to public (or the reverse) at any time:

- Changing the public setting updates who can read and create posts.
- Existing posts remain on the board; only visibility changes.

This lets you start with a private board while you refine your workflow and then open it up once you are ready to share more with customers.
