## Migration Strategies

Choose between gradual transition or complete cutover:

### Gradual Transition
Keep both platforms running temporarily:
1. Set up Featul workspace with matching boards
2. Add UserJot links pointing to new Featul portal
3. Encourage new feedback in Featul
4. Sunset UserJot after traffic shift

### Quick Cutover
Move everything at once:
1. Export key UserJot feedback
2. Recreate important posts in Featul
3. Redirect users to new portal
4. Archive UserJot boards

## User Communication

Guide users to your new portal:
- Add pinned post or banner in UserJot
- Include message: "We've moved! Submit new feedback at [your Featul URL]"
- Link to Featul workspace subdomain or custom domain

## Featul Setup

Prepare your new workspace:
- Create boards matching UserJot categories
- Use similar tags and naming for familiarity
- Consider "Migrated Feedback" board for historical requests

## Content Migration

Preserve high-value feedback:
1. Create new posts with original titles and descriptions
2. Add relevant tags and status
3. Link to original UserJot posts if needed

## Transition Tips

- Communicate change early to users
- Keep old URLs working if possible with redirects
- Preserve context through post content
- Monitor both platforms during transition for stragglers
