## Roadmap Boards

Transform feedback into visual development pipelines. Roadmap boards display feature requests organized by development stage, giving customers visibility into your product direction.

## Default Status Pipeline

Every roadmap board includes these statuses:

| Status | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | New requests awaiting review |
| **Review** | Under team consideration |
| **Planned** | Committed to development |
| **Progress** | Currently being built |
| **Completed** | Shipped and available |
| **Closed** | Won't be implemented |

## Customize Statuses

Adapt the pipeline to your workflow:

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select roadmap board
3. Click **Edit roadmap statuses**
4. Modify names, colors, and order
5. Save changes

Changes apply across all roadmap views and post cards.

## Manage Roadmap Items

Update item status through:
- **Drag and drop** between columns
- **Status dropdown** on individual posts
- **Bulk actions** for multiple items

Pin important items to keep them visible at the top of columns.

## Connect to Changelog

Complete the feedback loop:
1. Move completed features to **Completed** status
2. Create changelog entry for the release
3. Link changelog to original feedback post

This shows users their requests led to real product improvements.
