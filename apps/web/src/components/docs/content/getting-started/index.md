## Quick Setup

Create your feedback portal in three steps:

### 1. Create Account
Sign up with Google, GitHub, or email. Email users receive a verification code to complete registration.

### 2. Set Up Workspace
Choose a workspace name and subdomain (e.g., `yourproduct.featul.com`). This becomes your feedback portal URL.

### 3. Create First Board
Go to **Settings → Boards** and create a public feedback board. This is where customers submit ideas and vote on features.

## Customization Options

After setup, personalize your workspace:

- **Branding** – Upload logo and set brand colors
- **Domain** – Connect custom domain like `feedback.yourcompany.com`
- **Team** – Invite members to collaborate

## Share Your Portal

Distribute your workspace URL through:
- App navigation or help menus
- Onboarding emails
- Website feedback widgets
