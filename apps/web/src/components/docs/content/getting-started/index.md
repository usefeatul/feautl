## What featul gives you

featul is a workspace for collecting user feedback, prioritising requests, and publishing roadmap updates in one place.

There are a few core concepts:

- **Workspaces** group everything for a product or company.
- **Boards** organise feedback into public or private spaces.
- **Posts** represent individual requests, ideas, or changelog entries.
- **Members** collaborate on review, triage, and delivery.

## Recommended first steps

1. **Create your first workspace**  
   Sign in to the app and create a workspace for your product. This sets up default branding, feedback, and roadmap settings.

2. **Create at least one public board**  
   Use the workspace settings to create a feedback board where customers can share ideas and vote.

3. **Invite your team**  
   Invite team members so they can triage feedback, manage boards, and publish updates together.

4. **Connect a roadmap and changelog**  
   For most teams we recommend enabling a roadmap board and a changelog board to show what is planned and what has shipped.

5. **Share your feedback portal**  
   Share your workspace subdomain or custom domain with customers so they can start submitting feedback and voting on existing ideas.

From here you can dive into each section:

- **Create Boards** explains how to model your product areas.
- **Invite Members** covers roles and permissions.
- **Plan Roadmap** shows how to use roadmap statuses.
- **Publish Updates** walks through the changelog flow.
