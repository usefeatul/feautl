## Data Subject Rights

Under GDPR Chapter 3, you have the following rights regarding your Personal Data:

### Right to Rectification (Article 16)
You have the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate Personal Data concerning you. You may also complete incomplete Personal Data, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.

### Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten') (Article 17)
You have the right to obtain the erasure of Personal Data concerning you without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:
- **Purpose fulfilled**: The data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected

- **Unlawful processing**: The data has been processed unlawfully
- **Legal obligation**: Erasure is required to comply with EU or member state law
- **Children's data**: Data was collected in relation to information society services offered to children

This right is subject to exceptions, including when processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, compliance with legal obligations, or the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

### Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18)
You have the right to obtain restriction of processing where:
- **Accuracy contested**: You contest the accuracy of the data (for a verification period)
- **Unlawful processing**: The processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure
- **Purpose fulfilled**: We no longer need the data but you require it for legal claims
- **Objection pending**: You have objected to processing pending verification of legitimate grounds

During restriction, we may store the data but not process it further, except with your consent or for legal claims.

### Right to Data Portability (Article 20)

This right applies to data you have provided to us and includes the right to have the data transmitted directly to another controller where technically feasible.

We will cease processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

### Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making (Article 22)
You have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produce legal or similarly significant effects, subject to certain exceptions.

### Right to Withdraw Consent (Article 7)
Where processing is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
