## Changelog boards

Changelog boards are designed for:

- Public release notes.
- Internal change logs.
- Linking updates back to feedback and roadmap items.

Posts on a changelog board are announcement-style updates that explain what changed and why it matters.

## Changelog tags

Changelog boards can use reusable tags such as:

- Feature
- Improvement
- Fix
- Performance
- Security

28→These tags are used when you publish an update so readers can quickly scan the type of change.

## Creating a changelog entry

1. Open your workspace.
2. Navigate to your **Changelog** board or open **Settings → Changelog**.
3. Click **New entry**.
4. Provide:
   - A clear **title**.
   - A concise **summary** of what changed.
   - Optional **tags** that describe the type of change.
5. Publish the entry.
The entry appears on your changelog board and can also be linked from roadmap items or individual requests.

## Linking updates to feedback

When you ship a feature that originated from user feedback:

- Keep related requests in sync by updating their roadmap status (for example, to **Completed**).
- Reference relevant requests directly in the changelog content.
- Include links back to feedback so users can see which ideas were addressed.

## Surfacing updates on your portal

Changelog boards can be exposed on:

- Your workspace subdomain (for example, `your-product.featul.com`).
- Custom domains configured via `workspaceDomain`.

This gives your users a single place to discover what changed and why, without needing a separate release notes tool.
