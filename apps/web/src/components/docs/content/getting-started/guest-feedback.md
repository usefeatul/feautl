## Anonymous Submissions

Remove friction from feedback collection by allowing visitors to submit without creating accounts. This increases submission volume while maintaining quality control.

## Configuration

Enable guest submissions per board:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select target board
3. Enable **Allow anonymous submissions**
4. Configure additional options:
   - Allow guest comments
   - Require approval queue
   - Enable spam detection

## Moderation Controls

Maintain quality with built-in moderation tools:

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Approval queue** | Hold submissions for review before publishing |
| **Spam flagging** | Mark posts or comments as spam |
| **Archive** | Remove content from public view |
| **Reports** | Review user-submitted reports |

## When to Enable

Guest feedback works best for:
- Early-stage products building feedback base
- Marketing pages capturing visitor input
- Low-friction feedback widgets
- Public feature request boards

## When to Require Sign-in

Disable guest submissions when:
- Following up with specific users is critical
- Handling sensitive or confidential topics
- Experiencing spam or abuse issues
- Linking feedback to customer accounts is necessary

## Privacy Considerations

For sensitive boards (security, private roadmaps), disable anonymous submissions to ensure only authenticated users can contribute.
