## Anonymous feedback settings

Guest feedback is controlled at the board level. Each board has options that decide whether guests can submit ideas and whether comments are allowed.

## Enabling guest submissions

1. Open **Settings → Boards**.
2. Choose a public board where you want to allow guest feedback.
3. Enable **Allow anonymous submissions**.
4. Decide whether to keep comments open on the board.

Once enabled:

- Guests can submit posts without an account.
- The system can store basic context (like name or email if you request it) alongside the post.
- Identity settings decide how much is shown on public boards.

## Moderation and quality

Even with guest access, moderation tools remain available:

- You can hold submissions for approval before they appear.
- You can mark posts or comments as spam or archive them.
- You can review and resolve reports from your team or users.

Use these tools to keep your public boards healthy while still keeping friction low for new feedback.

## When to use guest feedback

Guest feedback is useful when:

- You want a very low-friction entry point to collect ideas.
- You are early in the product lifecycle and do not want to require login.
- You are capturing feedback from marketing pages or embedded widgets.

For high-sensitivity boards (for example, security or private roadmap), keep `allowAnonymous` disabled so that only signed-in users can contribute.
