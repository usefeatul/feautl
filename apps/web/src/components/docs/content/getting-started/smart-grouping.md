## Organization Hierarchy

Manage growing feedback volume with three organizational levels:

1. **Boards** – High-level separation by product area or content type
2. **Tags** – Flexible cross-board labeling system
3. **Statuses** – Workflow stage tracking

## Board Organization

Each post belongs to exactly one board. Use boards to separate:

- Product areas (Mobile, Web, API)
- Feedback types (Feature requests, Bug reports)
- Visibility levels (Public customer feedback vs. Internal ideas)
- Content types (Feedback, Roadmap, Changelog)

## Tag System

Apply multiple tags to any post for flexible categorization:

| Category | Example Tags |
|----------|--------------|
| **Customer segment** | Enterprise, SMB, Free, Pro |
| **Product area** | Onboarding, Billing, Reporting, API |
| **Theme** | UX, Performance, Reliability, Security |
| **Priority** | High-impact, Quick-win, Long-term |

Create and manage tags from the settings page or while editing posts.

## Status Management

Track content through two status types:

### Post Status
- **Draft** – Not yet visible
- **Published** – Live and visible
- **Archived** – Hidden but preserved
- **Spam** – Flagged as unwanted

### Roadmap Status (Roadmap boards only)
- **Pending** → **Review** → **Planned** → **Progress** → **Completed**

## Duplicate Management

Merge related requests to maintain clean boards:
1. Identify duplicate posts
2. Merge into primary post
3. Preserve votes and comments
4. Link original submitters to merged post

## Best Practices

- Start simple and add structure as patterns emerge
- Maintain consistent tag naming across your team
- Regularly archive resolved posts and clean unused tags
- Use boards for major divisions, tags for cross-cutting concerns
