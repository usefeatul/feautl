# Single Sign-On (SSO)

We're currently working on SSO support to enable secure, centralized authentication for your team.

## Coming Soon

SSO will allow your team members to access your Featul workspace using their existing corporate credentials, simplifying access management and improving security.

## Planned Providers

We're building integrations with popular identity providers including:

- SAML 2.0
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Okta
- Azure Active Directory
- Google Workspace

## Planned Benefits

- **Simplified access** — Team members use existing credentials
- **Centralized control** — Manage access from your identity provider
- **Enhanced security** — Enforce your organization's authentication policies
- **Automatic provisioning** — Users are created automatically on first login

> **Note:** SSO is currently in development. If you're interested in this feature, please reach out to us.
