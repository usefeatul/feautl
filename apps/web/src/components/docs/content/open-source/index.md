# Open Source

Featul is fully open source. You can view the entire codebase, contribute improvements, or self-host the platform for your own use. We believe in transparency and giving back to the developer community.

## Why Open Source?

We chose to make Featul open source because:

- **Transparency** — See exactly how your data is handled and how features work
- **Trust** — No black boxes or hidden functionality
- **Community** — Build together and benefit from collective improvements
- **Freedom** — Self-host, modify, and adapt to your specific needs
- **Longevity** — The code lives on even if the hosted service changes

## Source Code

The complete source code is available on GitHub. You're free to explore how Featul works, report issues, submit pull requests, or fork the project for your own needs.
