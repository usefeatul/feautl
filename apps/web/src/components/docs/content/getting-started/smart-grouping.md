## Why grouping matters

As feedback volume grows it becomes hard to see patterns if everything sits in a single list. featul uses a combination of:

- **Boards** for high-level separation.
- **Tags** for flexible labelling.
- **Roadmap statuses** for delivery stages.

## Grouping with boards

Boards are the first layer of grouping. Use them to separate:

- Product areas or modules.
- Public vs internal feedback.
- Roadmap, changelog, and idea intake.

Every post is linked to exactly one board.

## Grouping with tags

Tags are workspace-wide labels you can attach to posts.

Typical examples:

- Segment (`SMB`, `Enterprise`, `Pro`, `Free`).
- Area (`Onboarding`, `Billing`, `Reporting`).
- Theme (`UX`, `Reliability`, `Performance`).

You can:

- Create and manage tags from feedback or settings screens.
- Attach multiple tags to a single post.
- Filter and sort lists of posts by tag.

## Grouping with statuses

Two kinds of status help you keep a clear picture:

- **Post status** – content lifecycle (for example draft, published, archived).
- **Roadmap status** – delivery stage on roadmap boards.

In the UI you will typically:

- Filter lists by roadmap status on roadmap views.
- Filter by post status when moderating or cleaning up content.

## De-duplicating related feedback

For overlapping feedback you can merge related posts:

- Group duplicate posts into a single primary request.
- Preserve votes, comments, and tags when consolidating.

This keeps your grouping clean even when many customers ask for the same thing in different words.
