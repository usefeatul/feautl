## Privacy Settings

Control board visibility with three access levels:

| Type | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Public** | Anyone can view and submit feedback |
| **Private** | Only workspace members can access |
| **Unlisted** | Accessible via direct link, hidden from navigation |

## Internal Use Cases

Private boards support internal workflows:

- **Backlog grooming** – Discuss and prioritize before public sharing
- **Internal feedback** – Collect ideas from customer-facing teams
- **Early-stage concepts** – Test ideas internally before customer exposure
- **Sensitive topics** – Handle confidential features or issues

## Create Private Board

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Click **Create board** or edit existing
3. Disable **Public** toggle
4. Save changes

Private boards are invisible to non-members and don't appear in public navigation.

## Convert Privacy

Change board visibility at any time:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select target board
3. Toggle **Public** setting
4. Save changes

**Public → Private**: Content becomes team-only
**Private → Public**: Existing posts become customer-visible

Content remains on the board—only visibility changes.

## Best Practices

- Start private while establishing workflow
- Move to public when ready for customer feedback
- Use unlisted boards for beta users or specific groups
- Maintain private boards for internal prioritization
