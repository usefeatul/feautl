title: Migrate from UserJot
description: Transition your feedback collection from UserJot to Featul.

## Overview

If you're moving from UserJot (or a similar feedback tool), this guide helps you transition smoothly without losing your existing feedback or confusing your users.

## Migration strategy

There are two approaches to migration:

### Option 1: Gradual transition

Keep both platforms running temporarily while you move users over:

1. Set up your Featul workspace with matching boards
2. Add links in UserJot pointing to your new Featul portal
3. Encourage new feedback in Featul while keeping UserJot for reference
4. Eventually sunset UserJot once traffic has shifted

### Option 2: Quick cutover

Move everything at once:

1. Export key feedback from UserJot
2. Recreate important posts in Featul
3. Redirect users to your new portal
4. Archive or close your UserJot boards

## Linking from UserJot to Featul

To guide users to your new feedback portal:

1. Add a **pinned post** or **banner** in UserJot
2. Include a clear message like: "We've moved! Submit new feedback at [your Featul URL]"
3. Link to your Featul workspace subdomain or custom domain

## Setting up Featul for migrated users

On the Featul side:

- Create boards that match your UserJot categories
- Use similar tags and naming so users feel familiar
- Consider a "Migrated Feedback" board for imported historical requests

## Recreating important feedback

For high-value requests you want to preserve:

1. Create new posts in Featul with the same title and description
2. Add relevant tags and assign appropriate status
3. Link back to the original UserJot post in the content (if you want to preserve history)

## Tips for a smooth transition

- **Communicate early** – Let users know the change is coming
- **Keep URLs working** – If possible, redirect old URLs to Featul
- **Preserve context** – Use post content to reference original feedback sources
- **Monitor both** – Check UserJot periodically during transition for stragglers
