## What is a roadmap board?

A roadmap board shows where feature requests and ideas sit in your development pipeline. It gives customers visibility into what's planned, what's being worked on, and what's been shipped.

## How it works

Each post on a roadmap board has a **roadmap status**. The roadmap view displays posts in columns based on their status, making it easy to see progress at a glance.

## Default statuses

New roadmap boards include these statuses:

| Status | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | New requests that need review |
| **Review** | Under consideration by your team |
| **Planned** | Committed to building |
| **Progress** | Currently being developed |
| **Completed** | Shipped and available |
| **Closed** | Won't be implemented |

Each status has a name and color used throughout the UI.

## Customizing your roadmap

To match your team's workflow:

1. Go to **Settings → Boards** and select your roadmap board
2. Click **Edit roadmap statuses**
3. Make your changes:
   - Rename statuses to match your process (e.g., "In Development" instead of "Progress")
   - Change colors to align with your brand
   - Reorder statuses to fit your workflow
4. Click **Save**

Your changes apply everywhere roadmap status is displayed—board views, post cards, and detail pages.

## Moving posts through the roadmap

From the roadmap view, you can:

- **Drag and drop** posts between columns to change their status
- **Use the dropdown** on individual posts to update status
- **Pin important posts** to keep them visible at the top

## Connecting roadmap to changelog

When you complete a feature:

1. Move the post to **Completed** status
2. Create a changelog entry to announce the release
3. Link the changelog entry to the original post

This keeps your roadmap, feedback, and release notes connected without duplicating work. Users who requested the feature can see that it shipped.
