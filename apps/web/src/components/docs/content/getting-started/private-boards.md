## Public vs private boards

Every board has a privacy setting:

| Type | Who can access |
|------|----------------|
| **Public** | Anyone can view and submit feedback on your portal |
| **Private** | Only workspace members can access through the app |

You can also create "unlisted" public boards—accessible via direct link but not shown in navigation.

## When to use private boards

Private boards are useful for:

- **Internal feedback** – Collect ideas from customer-facing teams before they're ready to share publicly
- **Backlog grooming** – Discuss and prioritize requests before committing
- **Early-stage ideas** – Test concepts internally before opening for public feedback
- **Sensitive topics** – Handle feedback about confidential features or issues

## Creating a private board

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Click **Create board** (or edit an existing board)
3. Turn off the **Public** toggle
4. Save your changes

Once private:

- The board won't appear on your public portal
- Only workspace members can view posts and submit feedback
- All posts and comments remain internal

## Converting between public and private

You can change a board's privacy at any time:

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select the board you want to change
3. Toggle the **Public** setting
4. Save changes

When you make a board public:
- Existing posts become visible to everyone
- Customers can start submitting new feedback

When you make a board private:
- Posts are hidden from the public portal
- Only team members can access the content

Existing content stays on the board—only the visibility changes.

## Tips

- Start private while you're still setting up your workflow
- Move to public when you're ready for customer feedback
- Use private boards for internal prioritization meetings
- Consider unlisted boards for beta users or specific customer groups
