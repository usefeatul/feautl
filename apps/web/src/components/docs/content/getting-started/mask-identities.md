## Identity Protection

Hide user information from public view while maintaining full visibility for your team. This protects privacy without losing valuable context for follow-up and analysis.

## How It Works

| Setting | Public View | Internal View |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Masking disabled** | User names and avatars | Full user details |
| **Masking enabled** | "Anonymous" or generic labels | Full user details |

## Enable Identity Masking

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select public board
3. Enable **Hide member identity on public views**
4. Save changes

Changes take effect immediately across your public portal.

## Use Cases

Identity masking benefits:
- Customer privacy protection on public boards
- Internal context preservation for follow-up
- Competitive intelligence prevention
- Honest feedback collection with anonymity

## Anonymous vs. Masked

These features serve different purposes:

| Feature | Anonymous Feedback | Identity Masking |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **User identity** | Unknown to everyone | Known internally, hidden publicly |
| **Submission** | No account required | Account required |
| **Follow-up** | Not possible | Available through internal data |
| **Best for** | Low-friction public collection | Customer relationship management |

## Combined Usage

Use both features together:
- Enable anonymous submissions for zero-friction collection
- Enable identity masking to protect signed-in users

This provides clean public boards while preserving internal context for customer relationships.
