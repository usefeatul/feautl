title: Smart grouping
description: Organize feedback with boards, tags, and statuses as your volume grows.

## Why grouping matters

When feedback volume grows, a single list becomes overwhelming. Featul gives you three ways to organize:

1. **Boards** – High-level separation
2. **Tags** – Flexible labels
3. **Statuses** – Workflow stages

## Organizing with boards

Boards are your first layer of organization. Each post belongs to exactly one board.

Use boards to separate:

- Product areas (e.g., "Mobile", "Web", "API")
- Feedback types (e.g., "Feature Requests", "Bug Reports")
- Visibility levels (public customer feedback vs. internal ideas)
- Content types (feedback, roadmap, changelog)

## Organizing with tags

Tags are workspace-wide labels you can attach to any post. Unlike boards, a post can have multiple tags.

Common tagging strategies:

| Category | Example tags |
|----------|--------------|
| **Customer segment** | `Enterprise`, `SMB`, `Free`, `Pro` |
| **Product area** | `Onboarding`, `Billing`, `Reporting`, `API` |
| **Theme** | `UX`, `Performance`, `Reliability`, `Security` |
| **Priority** | `High-impact`, `Quick-win`, `Long-term` |

### Managing tags

- Create tags from the settings page or while editing posts
- Apply multiple tags to a single post
- Filter and sort by tags in list views
- Use consistent naming for easier filtering

## Organizing with statuses

Two types of status help track content:

### Post status
Tracks the content lifecycle:
- **Draft** – Not yet visible
- **Published** – Live and visible
- **Archived** – Hidden but preserved
- **Spam** – Flagged as unwanted

### Roadmap status
Tracks delivery stage (on roadmap boards):
- **Pending** → **Review** → **Planned** → **Progress** → **Completed**

## Merging duplicate feedback

When multiple customers request the same thing:

1. Identify related posts
2. Merge them into a single primary post
3. Votes and comments from merged posts are preserved
4. Original submitters are linked to the merged post

Merging keeps your board clean while preserving all the context and engagement.

## Best practices

- **Start simple** – Don't over-organize early. Add structure as patterns emerge.
- **Be consistent** – Use the same tag names across your team.
- **Review regularly** – Archive resolved posts and clean up unused tags.
- **Combine methods** – Use boards for major divisions, tags for cross-cutting concerns.
