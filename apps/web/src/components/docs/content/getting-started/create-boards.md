## How boards work

Boards are the main way you group feedback in featul. Each board belongs to a single workspace and represents a focused area, such as a product surface, roadmap, or changelog.

Each board defines:

- **Name and slug** – shown in the UI and used in URLs.
- **Privacy** – whether the board is accessible on your public portal.
- **Visibility** – whether a public board is listed in navigation.
- **Board type** – for example a regular feedback board, roadmap, or changelog.
- **Behaviour** – options such as anonymous posts, comments, and identity masking.
- **Roadmap and changelog options** – statuses and tags used to organise updates.

## Creating a new board

1. Open your workspace in the app.
2. Go to **Settings → Boards**.
3. Click **Create board**.
4. Choose a **name** and **slug**. The slug must be unique within the workspace.
5. Decide whether the board should be:
   - **Public** (customers can view and submit posts).
   - **Internal only** (team feedback or private triage).
6. Choose whether this board should behave like:
   - A **regular feedback board**.
   - A **roadmap board**.
   - A **changelog board**.
7. Configure whether you allow anonymous posts and comments.

When you save, featul creates the board with your chosen settings and default roadmap statuses and changelog tags.

## Default roadmap statuses

Roadmap-enabled boards include a default set of statuses:

- `Pending`
- `Review`
- `Planned`
- `Progress`
- `Completed`
- `Closed`
You can adjust the order, naming, and colours from workspace settings so the roadmap matches how your team works.

## Connecting boards to posts

Every piece of feedback belongs to a single board. When you create a post from the public portal or internal app, you choose which board it belongs to. Board settings such as anonymous submissions, comments, and identity masking determine how the post behaves.

Use multiple boards to separate:

- Product lines or modules.
- Public feedback vs. internal triage.
- Roadmap and changelog streams.
