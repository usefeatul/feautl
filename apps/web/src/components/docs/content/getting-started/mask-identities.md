## Identity controls

Boards include controls that decide how much identity is shown on public views:

- When identity masking is **off**, public viewers can see member names or avatars on posts and comments (subject to your UI configuration).
- When identity masking is **on**, public viewers see anonymised labels while internal members still see full details inside the app.

## Enabling identity masking

1. Open **Settings → Boards**.
2. Select a public board.
3. Enable **Hide member identity on public views**.
4. Save changes.

The public portal will:

- Avoid showing full member names or avatars for posts and comments.
- Still keep internal relationships intact for workspace members.

## How this works with anonymous feedback

Identity masking complements, rather than replaces, anonymous feedback:

- Use anonymous submissions when you want entirely guest feedback.
- Use identity masking when authenticated members contribute but you do not want to expose who specifically requested or commented on a feature.

Together these options give you:

- Clean public boards that respect privacy.
- Enough internal context to follow up with the right users.
