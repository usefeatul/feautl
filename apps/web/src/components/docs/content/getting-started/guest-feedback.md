## What is guest feedback?

Guest feedback lets visitors submit ideas without signing up for an account. This removes friction and can increase the volume of feedback you receive.

## How it works

Guest feedback is controlled at the board level. Each public board can allow or disallow anonymous submissions independently.

When enabled:
- Visitors can submit posts without creating an account
- You can optionally ask for name or email (but it's not required)
- Identity settings control what's shown publicly

## Enabling guest submissions

1. Go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Select a public board
3. Enable **Allow anonymous submissions**
4. Choose whether to allow comments from guests
5. Save your changes

## Moderation tools

Even with guest access, you have full control over content:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Approval queue** | Hold submissions for review before publishing |
| **Spam flagging** | Mark posts or comments as spam |
| **Archive** | Remove content from public view |
| **Reports** | Review user-submitted reports |

Use these tools to maintain quality while keeping the submission barrier low.

## When to enable guest feedback

Guest feedback works well when:

- You want the lowest possible friction for new ideas
- You're in early stages and building your feedback base
- You're capturing feedback from marketing pages or embedded widgets
- Your users aren't likely to create accounts

## When to require sign-in

Keep guest feedback disabled when:

- You need to know who's submitting (for follow-up or segmentation)
- The board handles sensitive topics
- You're experiencing spam issues
- You want to link feedback to customer accounts

For high-sensitivity boards (such as security or private roadmaps), keep anonymous submissions disabled so only signed-in users can contribute.
