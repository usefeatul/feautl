| **Changelog** | Announce releases | Product updates, release notes |

## Board Settings

Configure boards to match your workflow:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Privacy** | Public (customer access) or Private (team only) |
| **Visibility** | Show/hide in portal navigation |
| **Anonymous posts** | Allow submissions without sign-in |
| **Comments** | Enable/disable discussion |

## Roadmap Statuses

Customize status names, colors, and order in board settings.

## Organization Tips

Create separate boards for:
- Different product areas (Mobile, Web, API)
- Customer segments (Enterprise, SMB)
- Internal vs. external feedback
- Content types (feedback, roadmap, changelog)
