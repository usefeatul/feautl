## Team Roles

Control workspace access with role-based permissions:

| Role | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Full workspace control – settings, billing, members, all boards |
| **Member** | Manage feedback, boards, roadmap, changelog |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to content |

## Additional Permissions

Fine-tune access beyond basic roles:

- **Manage workspace** – Modify settings and configuration
- **Manage billing** – Access subscription and payment settings  
- **Manage members** – Invite, remove, modify team members
- **Manage boards** – Create, edit, delete boards
- **Moderate all boards** – Review and manage content across boards
- **Configure branding** – Customize appearance and theme

## Invite Process

1. Go to **Settings → Team**
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter email address
4. Select role and permissions
5. Send invitation

Invited members receive an email with workspace access link.

## Team Management

From **Settings → Team**, you can:

- Modify member roles and permissions
- Resend pending invitations
- Revoke unaccepted invitations
- Remove team members
- View member activity and access history

## Best Practices

- Assign the minimum role needed for each member's responsibilities
- Use **Viewer** role for stakeholders who need visibility without editing access
- Reserve **Admin** role for team members who manage workspace settings and billing
- Review team access regularly and remove inactive members
