## What are boards?

Boards are containers that organize your feedback. Each board can serve a different purpose—collecting feature requests, displaying your roadmap, or publishing changelog updates.

## Board settings

When you create a board, you can configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name & slug** | The display name and URL-friendly identifier |
| **Privacy** | Public (customers can access) or private (team only) |
| **Visibility** | Whether the board appears in your portal navigation |
| **Type** | Feedback board, roadmap, or changelog |
| **Anonymous posts** | Allow submissions without sign-in |
| **Comments** | Enable or disable discussion on posts |

## How to create a board

1. Open your workspace and go to **Settings → Boards**
2. Click **Create board**
3. Enter a **name** and **slug** (the slug must be unique)
4. Choose the board type:
   - **Feedback board** – For collecting feature requests and ideas
   - **Roadmap board** – For showing planned and in-progress work
   - **Changelog board** – For publishing release notes
5. Set privacy and other options
6. Click **Save**

## Board types explained

### Feedback boards

Standard boards where customers submit ideas and vote on features. Best for:

- Feature requests
- Bug reports
- General product feedback

### Roadmap boards

Display work across different stages (Planned, In Progress, Completed). Best for:

- Showing customers what you're building
- Internal planning and prioritization
- Transparency about your product direction

### Changelog boards

Announcement-style posts about what you've shipped. Best for:

- Release notes
- Product updates
- Keeping users informed

## Default roadmap statuses

Roadmap boards come with these default statuses:

- **Pending** – New requests awaiting review
- **Review** – Under consideration
- **Planned** – Committed to building
- **Progress** – Currently being worked on
- **Completed** – Shipped and available
- **Closed** – Won't be implemented

You can customize status names, colors, and order in your workspace settings.

## Tips for organizing boards

Consider creating separate boards for:

- Different product areas (e.g., "Mobile App", "Web Dashboard")
- Public feedback vs. internal team discussions
- Different types of content (feedback, roadmap, changelog)

Each post belongs to exactly one board, so plan your structure based on how you want to categorize and display feedback.
